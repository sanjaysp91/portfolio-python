# portfolio-python
These are my portfolio projects using Python Programming Language intended for interested clients. 

## 0. Begin Here
### 0.1 Working with Python Environment
#### 0.1.1. Each project gets its own python environment. 
    Default directory for env is: .venv
#### 0.1.2. "venv" is used for virtual python environments.
#### 0.1.3. Using python env: 
##### 0.1.3a. Check python version, use latest:
```bash
sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % python3 --version
Python 3.13.3
```

##### 0.1.3b. Create python env: 
```bash
sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % python3 -m venv .venv
```
##### 0.1.3c. Check newly created .venv directory: 
```bash
sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % ls -la
drwxr-xr-x  5 sap  staff    160 Sep  2 22:42 .
drwxr-xr-x  4 sap  staff    128 Sep  2 22:32 ..
-rw-r--r--@ 1 sap  staff   6148 Sep  2 22:32 .DS_Store
drwxr-xr-x@ 7 sap  staff    224 Sep  2 22:42 .venv
-rw-r--r--@ 1 sap  staff  18343 Sep  2 22:33 how-to-python.ipynb
```
##### 0.1.3d. Activate environment: 
```bash
sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % source .venv/bin/activate
```
##### 0.1.3e. Install requirements using requirements.txt 
```bash
(.venv) sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % pip install -r requirements.txt
Collecting jupyterlab... 
```
##### 0.1.3f. If new libraries are used, update requirements file: 
###### Manual: 
Maually add exact library that is installed using 'python3 -m pip install <lib_name>' command.

E.g. To install Jupyter Lab: 
```bash
(.venv) sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % python3 -m pip install jupyterlab
```
Manually append: jupyterlab==4.4.6 to requirements.txt file 
* tip to automate manual process:
```bash
pip freeze | grep 'jupyterlab' >> requirements.txt
echo "jupyterlab==4.4.6" >> requirements.txt
```
###### Update full list: 
```bash
(.venv) sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % pip freeze > requirements_full.txt 
```
#### 0.1.4. Start jupyterlab: 
```bash
(.venv) sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % jupyter lab
```
#### 0.1.5. deactivate the environment:
```bash
(.venv) sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % deactivate 
```

### 0.2 Lessons in Python using Jupyter Notebook (please skip this section to jump to projects)
Here is some information from a great book on Programming the Raspberry Pi by Simon Monk [1].

#### 0.2.1. Printing text

#### 0.2.2. Variables 

#### 0.2.3. Importing libraries (aka modules)

#### 0.2.4. For Loop
Example: Dice\
Example: Double Dice

#### 0.2.5. If Else and Elif 
Example: Two mutually exclusive clauses\
Example: Three mutually exclusive clauses

#### 0.2.6. While Loop 
* A well-known principle in programming is DRY (Don’t Repeat Y ourself).
* The condition for staying in the loop is permanently set to True. The loop will continue until it gets to break, which will only happen after throwing a double 6.

Example: Double Dice\
Example: While Loop with Break

#### 0.2.7. Strings 

#### 0.2.8. Lists 
* A string is a list of characters

Example: Complex structures, list of list \
Example: List with For Loop 

#### 0.2.9. Functions 
* As programs get larger, things get more complicated and it becomes necessary to break up your programs into units called functions. 
* There are better ways still of structuring our programs using classes and modules.
* The biggest problem in software development of any sort is managing complexity.
* The best programmers write software that is easy to look at and understand and requires very little in the way of extra explanation. 
* Functions are a key tool in creating easy-to-understand programs that can be changed without difficulty or risk of the whole thing falling into a crumpled mess.

Example: Hello n\
Example: Hangman Game 

#### 0.2.10. Dictionaries 
* Lists: work best when accessing data starting at beginning and working way through. 
* But when it comes to accessing a particular entry, they can be slow and inefficient. 
* It is like a book without index or table of contents. You have to read through whole. 
* Dictionaries: Provide more efficient means of accessing a data structure, going straight to an item of interest. 
* A value is associated with a key. Use the key to ask for a value. 
* The keys and values are created while the program is running. 

* The dictionary does not keep track of the order in which items were defined.
* KEY: string / number / tuple 
* VALUE: number, list, dictionary 

#### 0.2.11. Tuples 
* Tuples look like lists, but without the square brackets. 
* Tuples are immutable. You cannot change them. Strings and numbers are also immutable. 
* If a tuple is just a list that you cannot reassign, what is the use? 
* Tuple provides useful way of creating 'a temporary collection of items.
* There are some neat tricks using tuples. 

Example: Multiple Assignment\
Example: Multiple Return Values 

#### 0.2.12. Exceptions 
* Used to flag when something goes wrong in the program. 
* Python has a mechanism for intercepting errors and allowing to handle them in a custom way. 
* There is a hierarchy of different types of errors that can be caught. 

#### 0.2.13. Summary of useful functions 
| **Numbers** | **Strings** | **Lists** | **Dictionary** | **Type Conversions** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| abs(x) | s.capitalize() | del(a[i:j]) | len(d) | float() |
| bin(x) | s.center(width) | a.append(x) | del(dkey) | int() | 
| complex(r, i) | s.endswith(str) | a.count(x) | key in d | int('value', base) | 
| hex(x) | s.find(str)| a.index(x) | d.clear() | list('string') | 
| oct(x) | s.format(args) | a.insert(i, x) | get(key, default) | list(dict) | 
| round(x, n) | s.isalnum() | a.pop() | --- | --- | 
| math.factorial(n) | s.isalpha() | a.remove(x) | --- | --- | 
| math.pow(x, y) | s.isspace() | a.reverse() | --- | --- | 
| math.sqrt(x) | s.ljust(width) | a.sort() | --- | --- | 
| math.sin, cos, tan,<br>asin, acos, atan | s.lower, s.replace(old, new), <br>s.split(), s.splitlines(),<br>s.strip(), s.upper() | --- | --- | --- | 

#### 0.2.14. Object Orientation: Modules, Classes and Methods
* Custom python library is called module 
* Object-orientation: programs are structured into classes, each responsible for its own behaviour. 
* This helps to keep a check on program complexity and makes it easier to manage. This is done using classes and methods. 

* Modules 
    * create a group of functions and provide them in a convenient form for others to use or reuse in different projects 
    * module groups multiple objects and functions in a simple and elegant way. 
    * module name is same as the file name in which its constituents are defined. 

* Using Modules
    * Somewhere in the Python installation is a file called random.py that contains the randint and other functions.
    * Since there are so many modules, there is a real danger that different modules might have functions with the same name. 
    * Solution: None of the functions in the imported module are visible unless we prepend the module name and then a dot onto the front of the function name.

#### 0.2.15. Importing from modules 
* using local name for a module, local to the python file
* When certain about conflict free usage 
* import everything in one scoop

#### 0.2.16. Useful Python Module and Libraries 
| Module Name | Use | 
|---|---| 
| string | string utilities | 
| datetime | dates and times  |
| math | math functions  |
| pickle | data structures  |
| urllib.request | webpages  |
| tkinter | GUI |

#### 0.2.17. Object Orientation 
* Modules are part of object orientation
* Object orientation has same goals of grouping related items together, providing multiple things in a convenient form, structuring program into classes such that each is responsible for its own behaviour. 
* It is about objects. 
* Here, 'abc' is a string. A string is an object. We are telling python that we want a copy of the string 'abc' but in uppercase. 
* In object orientation terms, abc is an instance of the built-in class str and upper is a method on the class str. 
* note: "instance of a class" and "method on a class" 

Example: how to find out the class of an object: 'abc'.__class__

#### 0.2.18. Classes 
* Defining Classes 
    * Create a class that does the job of converting measurements from one unit to another by multiplying a value by a scale factor. 
    * Give the class a catchy name 
    
Example: converter_using_class

* Notes on Classes 
    * def __init__() is a function definition. 
        * This function can only be used via an instance of this class. This is also called method for the class. 
        * This method is automatically called as part of initiation. 
        * Number of parameters depend on parameters supplied during class instance creation.
        * self is always the first parameter. Self refers to the object itself. 
        * inside __init__(): new variables are created using assignments. These variables belong to the object and have their initial values set from the parameter set passed. 
        * __init__() is used to initialize and assign variables with default values. 

#### 0.2.19.  Encapsulation with Classes 
* Class should encapsulate everything that has to do with the class. E.g. storing data in variables, methods on the data
* All methods (including __ __init__ __()) must have self as a first parameter. The methods may or maynot need it to access the data of the class to which it belongs. 
* Each data that the methods use is called parameter. 

#### 0.2.20. Inheritance 
* Concept used to reduce and sometimes eliminate repearing code. Recall the well known principle in programming: DRY = Don't Repeat Youself! 
* Idea of inheritance in classes is that when you want a specialized version of a class that already exists, you inherit all the parent class's variables and methods 
* and just add new ones or override the ones that are different. 
* Classes are documented using UML diagrams: 

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ScaleConverter {
        - units_from
        - units_to
        - factor
        + description()
        + convert()
    }

    class ScaleAndOffsetConverter {
        - offset
        convert()
    }

    ScaleAndOffsetConverter --|> ScaleConverter
```
Example: Class definition using inheritance
* This example explores the following important aspects:
    * Specifying the parent class duing sub-class definition 
    * Invoking a method from the parent class 
    * Overriding a method from the parent class
    * Reusing a method from the parent class because DRY! (Don't Repeat Yourself) 

#### 0.2.21. Files 
* Python can be used to access files by reading and writing data. 
* Python variables aren't permanent in nature. Files provide a means of making data more permanent. 
* Reading file 
* Reading a file along with error handling 
* Reading big files: following becomes important  
    * Time to read data 
    * Memory used to store the data 
#### 0.2.22. File System 
* Python uses Linux to perform file-system-type operations (e.g. moving, copying a file or a directory).
* The functions are in **Shell Utility (shutil)** package. These work on directories as well as files. 
* Some features also deal with *file permissions* and *metadata*.
* **General uses**: copy, move, rename, remove, search file or directory 
* To copy, move, rename a file: **copy**
* To copy, move, rename a directory (including contents): **copytree**
* To remove a directory (including contents): **rmtree** 
* To search a directory: **glob**
* To save and load data to file: **pickle**

3. Open source, commercially usable - BSD license

### 3.1 Getting Started with scikit-learn
* an open-source machine learning library 
* supports supervised and unsupervised learning 
* provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection, model evaluation and other utilities
* main features of scikit-learn 
* Installation 
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment, refer section 0. Begin Here for more support. 
(venv) %
# Upgrade pip (optional but recommended)
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
# Install scikit-learn
python3 -m pip install scikit-learn
# Verify the installation
python3 -c "import sklearn; print(sklearn.__version__)"
# More detailed 
python3 -c "import sklearn; sklearn.show_versions()"
# Show scikit-learn version and location
python3 -m pip show scikit-learn  
# If it prints a version number (e.g., 1.3.2), scikit-learn is successfully installed.
(venv) % 1.7.2 
# Create project requirements files:
pip freeze > requirements_full.txt
pip freeze | grep 'scikit' >> requirements.txt
echo "scikit-learn==1.3.2" >> requirements.txt    # optional, use for appending 
``` 
* Dependency 
    * Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions starting with plot_ and classes ending with Display) require Matplotlib. 
    * The examples require Matplotlib and some examples require scikit-image, pandas, or seaborn.
```bash
# Install matplotlib: 
python3 -m pip install matplotlib==3.5.0    # specific version 
python3 pip -m pip install matplotlib    # latest version 
# Verify the installation
python3 -c "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.__version__)"
# You should see 3.5.0 (if installed specifically) or the latest version number.
(venv) % 3.10.6 
```
* Use Jupyter Notebook
```bash
python3 -m pip install jupyter lab
python3 -c "import jupyterlab; print(jupyterlab.__version__)"
(venv) % 4.4.9 
pip freeze > requirements_full.txt
pip freeze | grep 'jupyterlab=' >> requirements.txt
# echo "jupyterlab==4.4.9" >> requirements.txt

# start notebook
(venv) % jupyter lab
```

Here is some information from scikit-learn [2].

#### 3.1.1 Fitting and predicting: estimator basics 
* Built-in machine learning algorithms and models are called 'Estimators'.
* Each estimator can be fitted to data using its 'fit' method. 
Example: Fitting a RandomForestClassifier on sample data.
##### RandomForestClassifier 
* Fit methods accepts two inputs: sample matrix (aka design matrix, X) and target values (y).
* X: Size is (n_samples, n_features). Rows are Samples. Columns are Features.
* y: Real numbers for regression learning, discrete set for classification learning. y is not specified for unsupervised learning. Usually a 1d array where 'i'th entry is the target of the 'i'th sample (row) of X.
* Both X and y are numpy arrays or equivalent array-like data types. 

#### 3.1.2 Transformers and pre-processors 
* Pre-processing is a part of the machine learning workflow.
* Pre-processor transforms or imputes the data.
* Typical pipeline has a pre-processor and a final predictor.
* In scikit-learn, pre-processors and transformers inherit APIs from BaseEstimator class.
* Transformer objects have a transform method (and not a predict method) to output transformed matrix from X.
* ColumnTranformer is used for tranforming heterogeneous data. 

#### 3.1.3 Pipelines: combining pre-processors and estimators 
* Pipeline is an object that unifies tranformers and estimators (predictors).
* It has same API with 'fit' and 'predict' methods.
* Pipeline prevents data leakage e.g. disclosing testing data in training data. 

#### 3.1.4 Model evaluation 
* Model fitting doesn't always gurantee prediction accuracy. A lot depends on data used for training and data used in application. And hence the model needs to be directly evaluated.
* scikit-learn provides various tools for model evaluation.
Example: cross-validation 

#### 3.1.5 Automatic parameter search 
* All estimators have tunable parameters. These are also known as hyper-parameters.
* The estimators have what is called generalization power. And this can depend crtically on a few parameters.
* In the RandomForestRegressor, *n_estimators* is a parameter that determines the number of trees in the forest and *max_depth* is a parameter that determines each of the tree's max depth.
* And more often than not, it is unclear as to what the exact value of these critical parameters ought to be. The values generally depend on the data at hand.
* scikit-learn provides tools to automatically find the best parameter combinations via cross-validation.
Example: RandomizedSearchCV for RandomForestRegressor

##### Fun fact: Meaning of **ensemble**
##### Meaning of “ensemble” in English
* The word *ensemble* comes from French, meaning “together” or “as a whole”.
* In English, it’s used in contexts like:
    * A music ensemble → a group of musicians performing together.
    * A fashion ensemble → a coordinated outfit.
    * A theater ensemble → a cast of actors working as a team.
* So, the core idea is **a group of things working together to form a whole.**

##### Meaning of “ensemble” in Machine Learning
* In scikit-learn, the ensemble module provides *ensemble methods* — **techniques that combine multiple models (often called “weak learners”) to create a stronger overall model.**
* Examples in scikit-learn:
    * Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):
        * Train the same model (e.g., decision tree) on random subsets of data.
        * Combine their predictions (majority vote or average).
        * Example: BaggingClassifier
    * Random Forest:
        * A popular ensemble of decision trees trained with bagging + randomness.
        * Example: RandomForestClassifier
    * Boosting:
        * Models are trained sequentially, each correcting the mistakes of the previous.
        * Example: AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, HistGradientBoostingClassifier
    * Voting / Stacking:
        * Combine predictions from different types of models (e.g., SVM + Logistic Regression + Random Forest).
        * Example: VotingClassifier, StackingClassifier

##### The Logic of Ensemble Learning
* The logic comes directly from the English meaning:
    * **One weak model may make mistakes.**
    * **Many weak models, combined smartly, can cancel out individual errors and give better predictions.**
    * It’s like:
        * Asking one doctor for a diagnosis vs.
        * Asking a panel of 10 doctors and going with the majority opinion.
* This is why ensemble methods often outperform single models.

##### Fun fact: Meaning of **searchCV**
* **Search**: refers to *hyperparameter search* (trying out different parameter values to find the best model).
* **CV**: stands for *Cross-Validation*, a **resampling method** to evaluate models more reliably by splitting data into multiple train/test folds.
* So, SearchCV = Hyperparameter Search + Cross-Validation.
* Examples in scikit-learn
    1. GridSearchCV
       * Exhaustively tries all combinations of hyperparameters you specify.
       * Example: searching through all max_depth and n_estimators values for a RandomForestClassifier.
    2. RandomizedSearchCV
       * Randomly samples from the parameter space for a fixed number of iterations.
       * Faster when the parameter space is large.

##### Important Note on Searching
* Always prefer searching over a pipeline and not a single estimator.
* Preprocessing the whole dataset before CV leaks test data into training.
* This breaks independence between train/test sets.
* Result: overestimates model performance.
* Pipelines prevent this data leakage.

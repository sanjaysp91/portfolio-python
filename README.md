# portfolio-python
These are my portfolio projects using Python Programming Language intended for interested clients. 

## 0. Begin Here
### Working with Python Environment
#### 1. Each project gets its own python environment. 
    Default directory for env is: .venv
#### 2. "venv" is used for virtual python environments.
#### 3. Using python env: 
##### 3a. Check python version, use latest:
```bash
sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % python3 --version
Python 3.13.3
```

##### 3b. Create python env: 
```bash
sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % python3 -m venv .venv
```
##### 3c. Check newly created .venv directory: 
```bash
sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % ls -la
drwxr-xr-x  5 sap  staff    160 Sep  2 22:42 .
drwxr-xr-x  4 sap  staff    128 Sep  2 22:32 ..
-rw-r--r--@ 1 sap  staff   6148 Sep  2 22:32 .DS_Store
drwxr-xr-x@ 7 sap  staff    224 Sep  2 22:42 .venv
-rw-r--r--@ 1 sap  staff  18343 Sep  2 22:33 how-to-python.ipynb
```
##### 3d. Activate environment: 
```bash
sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % source .venv/bin/activate
```
##### 3e. Install requirements using requirements.txt 
```bash
(.venv) sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % pip install -r requirements.txt
Collecting jupyterlab... 
```
##### 3f. If new libraries are used, update requirements file: 
###### Manual: 
Maually add exact library that is installed using 'python3 -m pip install <lib_name>' command.

E.g. To install Jupyter Lab: 
```bash
(.venv) sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % python3 -m pip install jupyterlab
```
Manually append: jupyterlab==4.4.6 to requirements.txt file 
###### Update full list: 
```bash
(.venv) sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % pip freeze > requirements_full.txt 
```
#### 4. Start jupyterlab: 
```bash
(.venv) sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % jupyter lab
```
#### 5. deactivate the environment:
```bash
(.venv) sap@Sanjays-MacBook-Air use_jupyter % deactivate 
```
### Lessons in Python using Jupyter Notebook
Here is some information from a great book on Programming the Raspberry Pi [1].
#### 1. Printing text
#### 2. Variables 
#### 3. Importing libraries (aka modules)
#### 4. For Loop
    Example: Dice 
    Example: Double Dice
#### 5. If Else and Elif 
    Example: Two mutually exclusive clauses
    Example: Three mutually exclusive clauses
#### 6. While Loop 
    Example: Double Dice 
    * A well-known principle in programming is DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Y ourself). 
    
    Example: While Loop with Break
    * The condition for staying in the loop is permanently set to True. The loop will continue until it gets to break, which will only happen after throwing a double 6.
#### 7. Strings 
#### 8. Lists 
    * A string is a list of characters
    Example: Complex structures, list of list 
    Example: List with For Loop 
#### 9. Functions 
    * As programs get larger, things get more complicated and it becomes necessary to break up your programs into units called functions. 
    * There are better ways still of structuring our programs using classes and modules.
    * The biggest problem in software development of any sort is managing complexity.
    * The best programmers write software that is easy to look at and understand and requires very little in the way of extra explanation. 
    * Functions are a key tool in creating easy-to-understand programs that can be changed without difficulty or risk of the whole thing falling into a crumpled mess.
    
    Example: Hello n
    Example: Hangman Game 
#### 10. Dictionaries 
    * Lists: work best when accessing data starting at beginning and working way through. 
    * But when it comes to accessing a particular entry, they can be slow and inefficient. 
    * It is like a book without index or table of contents. You have to read through whole. 
    * Dictionaries: Provide more efficient means of accessing a data structure, going straight to an item of interest. 
    * A value is associated with a key. Use the key to ask for a value. 
    * The keys and values are created while the program is running. 

    * The dictionary does not keep track of the order in which items were defined.
    ** KEY: string / number / tuple 
    ** VALUE: number, list, dictionary 
#### 11. Tuples 
    * Tuples look like lists, but without the square brackets. 
    * Tuples are immutable. You cannot change them. Strings and numbers are also immutable. 
    * If a tuple is just a list that you cannot reassign, what is the use? 
    * Tuple provides useful way of creating 'a temporary collection of items.
    * There are some neat tricks using tuples. 

    Example: Multiple Assignment
    Example: Multiple Return Values 

#### 12. Exceptions 
    * Used to flag when something goes wrong in the program. 
    * Python has a mechanism for intercepting errors and allowing to handle them in a custom way. 
    * There is a hierarchy of different types of errors that can be caught. 

#### 13. Summary of useful functions 
| **Numbers** | **Strings** | **Lists** | **Dictionary** |
|---|---|---|---|
| abs(x) | s.capitalize() | del(a[i:j]) | len(d)
| bin(x) | s.center(width) | a.append(x) | del(dkey)
| complex(r, i) | s.endswith(str) | a.count(x) | key in d
| hex(x) | s.find(str)| a.index(x) | d.clear()
| oct(x) | s.format(args) | a.insert(i, x) | get(key, default)
| round(x, n) | s.isalnum() | a.pop() | --- | 
| math.factorial(n) | s.isalpha() | a.remove(x) | --- | 
| math.pow(x, y) | s.isspace() | a.reverse() | --- | 
| math.sqrt(x) | s.ljust(width) | a.sort() | --- |
| math.sin, cos, tan,<br>asin, acos, atan | s.lower, s.replace(old, new), <br>s.split(), s.splitlines(),<br>s.strip(), s.upper() | --- | --- |

## 1. Large Number Processing
This demonstrates:
1. Handling extremely large integers (math.factorial).
2. High-precision decimal arithmetic (decimal.Decimal).
3. Efficient processing of large datasets with big numbers.

#### Code
```python
# Increase Python's safety limit for converting big integers to string
sys.set_int_max_str_digits(1000000)

# 1. Arbitrary precision integers
large_factorial = math.factorial(5000)  
num_digits = len(str(large_factorial))  # number of digits in 5000!

# 2. High precision floating-point arithmetic
getcontext().prec = 50  # set precision to 50 decimal places
a = Decimal(1) / Decimal(7)             # precise fraction
b = Decimal(355) / Decimal(113)         # pi approximation

# 3. Processing a dataset of big integers
dataset = [10**50 + i for i in range(5)]  # simulate 5 huge integers
dataset_sum = sum(dataset)
```

#### Usage
```bash
(terminal)~% sudo python3 large-number-demo.py
```

#### Output
```txt 
Digits in 5000!: 16326
1/7 with high precision: 0.14285714285714285714285714285714285714285714285714
Approximation of pi: 3.1415929203539823008849557522123893805309734513274
Sum of dataset of huge numbers: 500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010
```

## 2. Prompt Automation 
This demonstrates:
1. Handling LLM/GPT API services including model selection.
2. Function definition for setting response, messages and temperature. 
3. Basic Architecture for prompt and response. 

#### Code
```python
# Function 
def llm_response(prompt):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model='gpt-3.5-turbo',
	messages=[{'role':'user', 'content':prompt}],
	temperature=0
    )
    return response.choices[0].message['content']
```

#### Usage
```bash
(terminal)~% sudo python3 openai_1.py
```

#### Output
```txt 
Hello, World
Positive
```
